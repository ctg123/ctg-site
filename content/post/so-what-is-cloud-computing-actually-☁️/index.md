Hi Folks!

Have you ever wondered – What Is Cloud Computing actually? For example, Are you curious as to how your Google drive or Dropbox is capable of doing what it does?

Cloud computing is a set of computing resources developed that contain certain elements of compute, networking, and storage capabilities. Think of it as a platform for managing, storing, and processing data that is always online and can be accessed anywhere where a reliable internet connection exists.

Some of the cloud computing features include the following:

* ***On-Demand Services*** – Available when you need it 24/7.
* ***Network Access*** – When using the internet as your medium.
* ***Shared Resources*** – All resources are gathered together and used by multiple customers.
* ***Scalability*** – The ability of a computer system to adapt to increasing demands.

The are Three primary delivery models in which Cloud computing can provide different services based on their unique configuration characteristics.
