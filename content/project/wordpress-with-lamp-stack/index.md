  This Playbook will install a WordPress Content Management System (CMS) on top
  of a LAMP environment (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) on two remote servers in
  a private network. The LAMP versioning highlights the following for each
  layer:


  * **Linux** - Ubuntu 18.04 ( 1 Virtual machine designated as the master node and two managed nodes for hosting the WordPress CMS). Vagrant and VirtualBox create these machines.

  * **Apache2** - The Apache HTTP server is the most widely-used web server in the world. It provides many powerful features, including dynamically loadable modules, robust media support, and extensive integration with other popular software.

  * **MySQL 5.7** - MySQL is the worldâ€™s most popular open-source relational database management system.

  * **PHP 7.4** - PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
