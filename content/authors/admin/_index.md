Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! üëãüèæ

My name is Chaance Graves. Welcome to my website, where I share the projects that I‚Äôve worked on or still tinkering with. I‚Äôm a creative problem solver eager to implement solutions to many issues foreseen in our modern society. In addition to that, I am also a big advocate for giving back to others who aspire to follow a path like mine.

I currently work at Intel Corporation in the Datacenter AI group as a Platform Applications Engineer. I provide technical support and expertise for Intel server CPUs and server board design development for customers such as¬†[Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/category/data-center-engineering/),¬†[Google](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/),¬†[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/), etc. My primary OEM customer designs cloud computing server systems for Verizon Media (formerly Yahoo!), Apple, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
