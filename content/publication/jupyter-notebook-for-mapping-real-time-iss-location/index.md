This notebook is a built-in Jupyter notebook in Jupyterlab and conda environment. The example will walkthrough interacting with a real-time API tracking the location of the International Space Station. You can collect and save your own data in this example.

### Conda environment with environment.yml

![https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)

A Binder-compatible repo with an `environment.yml` file.

Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL:

### Notes

The `environment.yml` file should list all Python libraries on which your notebooks depend, specified as though they were created using the following `conda` commands:

```bash
conda activate example-environment
conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml
```

Note that the only libraries available to you will be the ones specified in the `environment.yml`, so be sure to include everything that you need!

Also, note that if you skip the `--from-history`, conda may include OS-specific packages in `environment.yml`, which you would have to manually prune from `environment.yml`.
